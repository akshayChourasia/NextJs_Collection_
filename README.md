# Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework that enables several additional features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. It is built on top of React and provides an intuitive, out-of-the-box setup for building scalable applications.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Next.js allows you to render pages on the server, providing better performance and SEO benefits compared to client-side rendering. This means that the content is fully rendered on the server and sent to the client, which improves the initial load time and ensures that search engines can index your content more effectively.

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
With Next.js, you can generate static HTML pages at build time, which can be served directly by a CDN. This results in incredibly fast load times and improved scalability, as the pages are pre-rendered and do not require a server to generate the content on each request.

### 3. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Next.js allows you to update static content after youâ€™ve built your site. With ISR, you can create or update static pages after the site has been built, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date without rebuilding the entire site.

### 4. API Routes
Next.js supports API routes, enabling you to build full-stack applications by creating API endpoints that are served by the same application. This allows you to handle backend logic, such as form submissions, user authentication, and data fetching, within your Next.js application.

### 5. File-Based Routing
Next.js uses a file-based routing system, which means that the structure of your pages directory determines the routing of your application. This makes it easy to create and manage routes without having to configure a separate router.

### 6. Built-In CSS and Sass Support
Next.js has built-in support for CSS and Sass, allowing you to import CSS files and Sass modules directly into your components. This simplifies the styling process and enables you to use modern CSS features and preprocessors.

### 7. Image Optimization
Next.js includes an optimized image component that automatically resizes, optimizes, and serves images in modern formats like WebP. This helps improve the performance and loading times of your pages.

## Getting Started with Next.js
